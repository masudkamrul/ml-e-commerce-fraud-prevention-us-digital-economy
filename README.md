# Machine Learning–Driven E-Commerce Fraud Prevention for the U.S. Digital Economy

This repository contains ongoing machine learning research aimed at reducing online fraud affecting U.S. consumers and retailers.

The project focuses on three significant fraud categories affecting national digital commerce:

1. Online shopping fraud (fake stores, non-delivery scams)
2. Phishing-enabled fraud (malicious URLs and credential theft)
3. Digital payment fraud (unauthorized transactions)

The initiative supports safer e-commerce environments and improved consumer trust, both of which are essential for the resilience of the U.S. digital economy.

## 🔹 Project Objectives

- Develop ML models to detect fraudulent transactions
- Analyze behavioral and technical fraud indicators (device, IP, location anomalies)
- Create real-time risk scoring and alerting methods
- Generate insights to support academic research and cybersecurity improvements

This work aligns with **federally recognized** national needs in cyber fraud prevention and digital economic protection.

## 🔹 Tech Stack

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebooks for model experimentation
- Streamlit prototype planned for future testing

---

## 🔹 Status: Active Research and Development

Current assets include:

- Dataset integrated into ML pipeline
- Baseline and advanced fraud detection models (in progress)
- Documentation of architecture and national priority relevance
- Evaluation notebooks for performance validation

Future expansions:

- Risk scoring prototype tools
- Additional features for complex fraud behavior detection

Development is ongoing as part of an early-stage research initiative.
